## My process
First, one needs to evaluate the design and think of an appropriate HTML construction for the same. Once that was done, I coded the HTML and then moved to the CSS.
The CSS took quite a lot of trial and error since I was quite new to web development, but in the end I finished the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

CSS flexbox
Positioning of divs
Box-shadow

### Code snippets

```html
<main>
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR-code"/> 
        <h1>
